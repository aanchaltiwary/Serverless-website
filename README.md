Serverless is a process which shows services, practices and strategies which is used to build a website so as to innovate and develop for faster changes. Serverless computing contains infrastructure management tasks as capacity provisioning and patching. Developers can easily focus on developing code that serves the customer. serverless services like AWS lambda has a quality of auto scaling and pay as per use billing model. Serverless infrastructure does not require any servers. Developers can focus on core product and a business logic.
